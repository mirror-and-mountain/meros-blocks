## MEROS BLOCKS

### About
Meros Blocks is our first Wordpress starter theme powered by the [Meros Framework](https://github.com/mirror-and-mountain/meros-framework). Its goal is to provide a developer-friendly environment for creating block-based themes that benefit from a standardised approach for adding features through a Laravel-esque syntax and overall experience.

### Getting started
To start creating a new theme run the following command:
```console
composer create-project mirror-and-mountain/meros-blocks <YourThemeName>
```

### License 
Meros Themes are open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license. Note that if you wish to publish any theme created from this project, you will need to license it in accordance with the [Wordpress guidelines.](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/)
